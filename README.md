# Graph-analysis-of-language-network
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a network disorder that alters the total organization of the language-related network. 
Task-based functional MRI (fMRI) aimed at functional connectivity (FC) is a direct method to investigate how the network is reorganized. 
However, such studies are scarce and represented mostly by the resting-state analysis of the individual connections between regions. 
To fill this gap, we used a graph-based analysis, which allows us to cover the total language-related network changes, 
such as disruptions in an integration/segregation balance, during a language task in TLE.
